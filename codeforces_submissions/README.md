This repoitory containes all the submissions that were accepted in codeforces (almost). I used a script for this and that script failed in some cases. The files are structued in this way:


      user->
          ->contest_id
              ->submission_id

main.py is a python 2 script used to scrape these ac submissions from my id in codeforces using codeforces API and bs4 library.
